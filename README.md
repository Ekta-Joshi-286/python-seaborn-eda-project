# 📊 Python Seaborn EDA Projects

This repository contains **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** projects created using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.  
All analyses are performed on **built-in Seaborn datasets** to understand data patterns, trends, and relationships through visualization.
